# LR_Delivery_Time_Prediction

## Repository Contents  
This repository contains:  
- Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) for delivery time prediction  
- Assignment Report (`.pdf`)  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on order delivery data  

## Technologies Used  
This project utilizes the following Python libraries:  
- Seaborn – for data visualization  
- Matplotlib – for plotting graphs  
- Pandas – for data manipulation  
- NumPy – for numerical computing  

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes order delivery patterns using real-world data.  
The goal is to predict delivery time accurately and enhance operational efficiency through EDA and regression techniques.  

## Acknowledgements
